# Melanoma Recognition
This is a Digital Image Processing (DIP) course project, which were implemented some DIP algorithms in order to extract melanoma features.

The Kmeans technique applied to classify the tumor did not achieved fair results. It can be improved by using Neural-Networks techniques. However, the characteristcs extraction mechanisms are working good enought for the proposed implementation.
